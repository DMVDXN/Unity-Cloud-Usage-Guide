# 📂 Plastic SCM vs Gluon - Unity Version Control

This section explains the difference between **Plastic SCM** and **Gluon**, the two version control interfaces available through Unity’s Plastic SCM system.

***Note you can search for "Plastic SCM" and "Gluon" in your windows application panel to find these applications on your device after you have installed and enabled Unity Version Control or Plastic SCM from the editor***

---

## 🔍 Overview

Unity offers two interfaces for using version control:

- **Plastic SCM (Full Interface)** – designed for programmers and advanced users
- **Gluon** – designed for artists and non-technical team members

Both tools help you manage changes to your Unity project, but they work differently based on your role and workflow needs.

---

## 🧰 Comparison Table

| Feature | **Plastic SCM (Full Interface)** | **Gluon (Simplified Interface)** |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Target Users** | Developers & advanced users | Artists, designers, non-tech team members |
| **Complexity** | Advanced & powerful | Easy & beginner-friendly |
| **Workflow** | Branch-based, full version control | File-based, simple change tracking |
| **Branching Support** | ✅ Full branching & merging | ❌ Limited (not user-accessible) |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Manual merge tools, full control | Basic auto-merge or overwrite |
| **Partial Checkout** | ✅ Yes (choose specific folders/files) | ✅ Yes (main focus of Gluon) |
| **Interface Style** | Technical UI (like Git clients) | Visual, drag-and-drop UI |
| **Scene Merge** | ✅ Yes (merge scenes with tools) | ⚠️ Not recommended (limited control) |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- **Plastic SCM** is best for:
  - Programmers and technical team members
  - Projects with complex branching, merging, or lots of code
  - Advanced control over version history

- **Gluon** is best for:
  - Artists and designers working on assets
  - Teams that want a simple workflow with fewer conflicts
  - Users who prefer not to deal with branches or merges

---

## ✅ Recommendation

| Role | Recommended Tool |
|------|------------------|
| Programmer | **Plastic SCM** |
| Artist / Designer | **Gluon** |
| Mixed Role | **Plastic SCM** (for full control) |

---

## 📎 Additional Notes

- Both Plastic SCM and Gluon work with Unity projects and can connect to the same cloud repository.
- You can mix usage in the team—developers use Plastic, artists use Gluon—as long as coordination is maintained.

---

Happy collaborating! 🔧🎨

---

### Option B: Git

1. Use your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  
2. Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude the following folders:

    ```
    Library/
    Temp/
    Builds/
    ```

   [![Watch on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GzLKfbch3oU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzLKfbch3oU)

---
## 💡 Best Practices

- ✅ Always enable **Collaborators** in your Unity Organization settings.  
- ✅ Use **environment variables** in build scripts for secrets and API keys.  
- ✅ Test **Cloud Save** functionality using development builds first.  
- ✅ Separate build targets for **staging** and **production** environments.  
- ✅ Regularly monitor **Cloud Diagnostics** for crash patterns.
- ✅ **Warning** Uploading large number of files through the web can be risky. The recommended best practice is to limit your web upload to 500 files max with a 20GB limit only. Alternatively, upload using Unity Version Control and then index your files.

# 🎫 What Are Seats in Unity?

A **seat** refers to **a license assigned to one user** — like a “ticket” that gives someone access to Unity’s services and tools under a specific plan (Pro, Plus, Enterprise, etc.).

Think of it this way:

> 🧍‍♂️ One developer working on Unity needs **one seat**.  
> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A team of 5 developers? You need **5 seats** — one for each user.

---

## 🧩 What Does a Seat Include?

When you assign someone a seat, they get:

- Access to the Unity Editor under the paid plan (Pro, Plus, etc.)
- Ability to use cloud services (like Build Automation, Remote Config, etc.)
- Permission to collaborate on Unity projects via version control
- Access to Unity’s dashboards, usage data, and APIs
- License to use certain Unity tools and plugins restricted to the paid tier

---

## 💼 Seat Assignment and Management

- You manage seats through the [Unity Dashboard](https://id.unity.com/organizations).
- Only an **Organization Owner or Manager** can assign/unassign seats.
- Seats can be reassigned to a different user, but **not shared simultaneously**.

---

## 💰 Seat Pricing Example

| **Plan**     | **Monthly Cost per Seat** | **Annual Cost per Seat** | **Notes**                      |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Plus         | $15                        | $180                       | One seat per user needed       |
| Pro          | $40                        | $480                       | Same rule — 1 seat = 1 user    |
| Enterprise   | Custom                     | Custom                     | Usually negotiated in bulk     |

> **Example:** A 3-person team using Unity Pro would pay:  
> **3 seats × $40/month = $120/month** or **$1,440/year**

---

## 🛠️ Summary

| **Term**     | **Meaning**                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Seat**     | A license assigned to one team member            |
| **Why it matters** | Determines who can use paid features and cloud tools |
| **1 user = 1 seat** | You cannot share seats simultaneously between users |

# 🎮 Unity Team Project - Merging Multiple Scenes

This guide explains how to merge multiple Unity scenes from different team members (in separate projects) into one central Unity project.

---

## ✅ Overview

Each team member has been working on a different scene in their own Unity project. The goal is to combine all scenes into a single Unity project without losing any assets or functionality.

---

## 🔁 1. Choose a Main Project

Designate one Unity project to be the **main/central project** where all scenes and assets will be merged.

---

## 📦 2. Export Scenes from Other Projects

For each teammate's Unity project:

1. Open the Unity project containing your scene.
2. In the **Project window**, locate the folder containing:
   - Your `.unity` scene file
   - Any models, textures, prefabs, scripts used in the scene
3. Right-click the folder ➜ Select **Export Package…**
4. In the export window, check **"Include Dependencies"**
5. Click **Export** and save the `.unitypackage` file

---

## 💻 3. Import Packages into the Main Project

In the main Unity project:

1. Open the project in Unity
2. Right-click in the **Project window** ➜ Select **Import Package > Custom Package…**
3. Choose the `.unitypackage` file from a teammate
4. Import all assets when prompted
5. Repeat for all teammates' scenes

---

## 🧹 4. Organize and Rename

After importing:

- Rename each scene clearly (e.g., `LockerRoom.unity`, `MainMenu.unity`, etc.)
- Store all scenes in `Assets/Scenes/TeamScenes/` or a similar directory

---

## 🔄 5. Scene Navigation (Optional)

To switch between scenes in the game:

Use Unity’s built-in scene manager. Example:

<div style="max-width: 600px; overflow-x: auto;">

<pre><code>
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class SceneSwitcher : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void LoadScene(string sceneName)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
}
</code></pre>

</div>

---
## 🧾 Conclusion

Unity Cloud Services simplify development workflows by handling builds, syncing data, and managing version control through a unified interface. Based on testing, the setup process is straightforward, but some services may require additional permissions or API calls.
